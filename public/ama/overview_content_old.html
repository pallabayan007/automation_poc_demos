									<h3>Dynamic Monitoring Automation - Technology</h3>
									
										<p>
											Swarnasetu (aka Golden Bridge) is an Application Monitoring Automation solution aimed at automating the remedial actions for all incidents and alerts that are triggered for issues occurring in any application where this solution has been implemented in projects across GBS. 
									  	</p>
								  			<img src="../images/image001.png" style="" />
										 <p>
										 	It is a part of the automation program for linking Application Monitoring System with Infrastructure Optimization. This technology connects tools of application monitoring (e.g. SAP –Solution Manager, IBM Tivoli Monitor) with infrastructure management tools (e.g. IPSoft, Blue Prism). It is a key capability in terms of completing the DevOps "circle of life" for AMS and ITS business. Our unique and innovative bridging technology leverages:
										 </p>	
								  
										<ol>
										<li>	Real Time view  for Standard Operation Procedure(SOP) </li>
										<li>	Secure SOP from outside world</li>
										<li>	Integration with Service Management System (e.g. IPSoft, Blue Prism)</li>
										<li>	Integration with Service Monitoring System (e.g. SAP _solution Manager, IBM Tivoli Monitoring)</li>
										<li>	Bridging Systems for automation of SOP </li>
										<li>	Visibility of current integration flow </li>
										<li>	Administrating operational for SOP access virtual engineers</li>
										</ol>												  
								  
								  	
								  <h3>Current Business  Challenges</h3>			
								  <p>
								  In an enterprise IT System, alerts/incidents/tickets are being created on a daily basis for issues reported from various System Applications and Infrastructure. In order to remediate the problems some unstructured tasks need to be executed manually. In the absence of a proper tool to manage the incidents and ticket handling process and undefined /unstructured way of defining task for ticket incident remediation, a lot of manual effort is wasted on analysis, co-ordination and closure of incidents from multiple systems. Due to the lack of a centralized tool, with analytical capability the current incident handling process leads to considerable wastage of effort and resources. 
								  </p>
								  
								  <h3>How Does The Technology Work ? </h3>	
								  
								  <p>
								  SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) are used in many regulated industries to ensure that a variety of critical business processes, procedures, and policies are performed properly. IT industries are also defining SOP’s as problem remediation steps for specific incidents/alerts/tickets raised by System’s Application and Infrastructure. SOPs are detailed descriptions of the steps to be performed and they become a key focal point during inspections and audits by regulating bodies and authorities.
								  </p>
								  
								  <p>
								  Swarnasetu is meant for managing SOP’s, leverage bridging mechanism between Service Monitoring System to Service Management System for automatically executing the remediation to help track and manage any organization's SOPs and monitor the bridging technology.
								  </p>
								  
								  <p>
								  Swarnasetu is a single platform solution that provides everything you need to manage SOPs, automate SOPs to be executed dynamically, quickly and easily – using underline bridging mechanism between App/Infra Monitoring System and App/Infra Managing System.
								  </p>
